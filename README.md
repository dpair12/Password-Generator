# Password-Generator
This is a password generator that was made with JavaScript that I created. 

# Project Description
This project is a representation of what I learned so far when it comes to JavaScript. Using the ReadMe that was provided for Challenge 3, I performed the following functions:

Created a Password Generator that is programmed with logic from JavaScript file.
Designed logic to take user input such as ideal password length and characters the user wants to have included (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special) to make a string that displays a randomly generated password.
Designed logic to only allow passwords to be created with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128.
Designed logic to require user to select one character type before password is generated.
Designed logic to generate password once all prompts have been answered and to display it in placeholder on the Password Generator card.
